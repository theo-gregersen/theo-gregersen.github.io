Hi! 
I'm a fifth-year master's student studying computer science at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle.
My current research on energy efficiency in datacenters is advised by [Tom Anderson](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/tom) in the [UW Syslab](https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/). 
I also did my undergrad at UW and was advised by [Franziska Roesner](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/franzi) in the [UW Security & Privacy Research Lab](https://seclab.cs.washington.edu/).
My undergrad research focused on digital content and misinformation, and I wrote a thesis on privacy enforcement in software services.
I'll be starting my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) later this year.
