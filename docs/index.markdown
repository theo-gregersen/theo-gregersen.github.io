Hi! 
I'm a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, advised by [Greg Ganger](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/) in the [PDL](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/index.shtml).
I'm interested in distributed systems and resource efficiency at scale.

Before CMU, I completed my BS/MS at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle.
At UW, I researched datacenter sustainability with [Tom Anderson](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/tom) in the [Syslab](https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/). 
I also studied misinformation and privacy enforcement with [Franziska Roesner](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/franzi) in the [Security & Privacy Research Lab](https://seclab.cs.washington.edu/).
