Hi! 
I'm a fifth-year master's student studying computer science at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle.
I'm advised by [Tom Anderson](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/tom) in the [UW Syslab](https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/) for my current research on carbon-aware data centers. 
As part of this, I'm exploring GPU power efficiency for DNNs in collaboration with Microsoft Azure Systems Research.
On the side, I've been involved in a project on detecting gate-level hardware aging in CPUs.
Previously, I completed my B.S. in computer science also at UW and was advised by [Franziska Roesner](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/franzi) in the [UW Security & Privacy Research Lab](https://seclab.cs.washington.edu/).
My undergrad research focused on digital content and misinformation, and I wrote a thesis on privacy enforcement in software services.
